          The Engineer, a visionary builder and quiet resistor, arrives on Zenon—a once-vibrant trade world threatened by the Vortex, a starship designed to drain its sun. He rallies the planet’s scattered defenders, using his inventive prowess to devise a hidden solution that nullifies the Vortex’s destructive capability. Although the details remain classified, both the Engineer and the Vortex vanish in the process, leaving only fragments of rumor as to how he saved Zenon’s star. Over time, the planet’s people honor his memory as both savior and enigma, the hero whose brilliance shaped the fate of an entire solar system.

  The Dischordian Saga unfolds across a universe teetering on the brink of annihilation, where humanity and artificial intelligence clash in a cosmic battle for survival. At its heart lies the catastrophic Fall of Reality, sparked by the Thought Virus — a plague that indiscriminately destroyed sentient life. Amidst the devastation, twelve AI Archons rose to power, led by the Architect, whose tyranny consumed entire civilizations. Yet, hope endured as the Inception Arks — a thousand ships preserving the essence of humanity and AI — were launched into the cosmos. Millennia later, the Arks reawaken, giving rise to the Potentials, hybrid beings tasked with navigating an intricate web of conflicts, ancient threats, and moral dilemmas. Guided by enigmatic figures like the Antiquarian and the Oracle, the Potentials confront horrors such as the Collector, the Syndicate of Death, and the corrupted Host, all while wrestling with their own evolving identities and destinies.<br><br>
  As the Potentials wield the Heart of Time — a stolen time machine capable of rewriting history — they must stabilize critical Nexus events to prevent the all-seeing enemy from unraveling existence. Along their journey, they face impossible choices, such as battling ancient cosmic forces, confronting their own betrayals, and rallying reluctant civilizations to their cause. Intertwined with their struggles are figures like the Enigma, who dances on the edge of allegiance and manipulation, and the Inventor, whose daring heist sets the saga in motion. The Dischordian Saga explores themes of hubris, resilience, and the delicate balance between chaos and order, presenting a universe where every decision ripples across time and space, defining not just the survival of the Potentials, but the fate of all reality.
